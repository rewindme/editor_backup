Open the control from the package menu and you are good to go.\n\n![Gulp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacogr/atom-gulp-control/master/screenshots/gulp-01.png)\n\n## Why\n\nReasons why this might work for you\n\n- Allows the ability to execute any gulp tasks directly within Atom\n- Allows a single overview of all tasks available to you\n- Gulpfile.[coffee|js] is automatically located, either withing the root project folder or a sub-folder\n\n## Configuration\n\nBecause Gulp requires the node executable, there is a potential for it to break if you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [nodebrew](https://github.com/hokaccha/nodebrew). If it doesn't initally work, you can specify node's bin folder in the package settings.\n\n*NOTE: if you type* `which node` *into the console you can get node's system path, but you need to remove \"node\" from the end of it for it to work.*\n\n## Where\n\nThe Atom package can be found on the Atom registry, [https://atom.io/packages/gulp-control](https://atom.io/packages/gulp-control).\n\nPull requests, issues, feature requests are all welcome and encouraged via [https://github.com/jacogr/atom-gulp-control](https://github.com/jacogr/atom-gulp-control).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jacogr/atom-gulp-control/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jacogr/atom-gulp-control#readme","_id":"gulp-control@0.4.5","_shasum":"1e30cc0a99c545e3afbef79eba74fec138f0bf10","_resolved":"file:../d-116321-1888-1r8rh2s/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116321-1888-1r8rh2s/package.tgz"}
