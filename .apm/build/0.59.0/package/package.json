(all previous options are viable here except `targets`)\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nNote that if `sh` is false `cmd` must only be the executable - no arguments here.  If the\nexecutable is not in your path, either fully qualify it or specify the path\nin you environment (e.g. by setting the `PATH` var appropriately on UNIX-like\nsystems).\n\nIf `sh` is true, it will use a shell (e.g. `/bin/sh -c`) on unix/linux, and command (`cmd /S /C`)\non windows.\n\nUsing a JavaScript (JS) file gives you the additional benefit of being able to specify `preBuild` and `postBuild`. Keep in mind\nthat the JavaScript file must `export` the configuration\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  cmd: \"myCommand\",\n  preBuild: function () {\n    console.log('This is run **before** the build command');\n  },\n  postBuild: function () {\n    console.log('This is run **after** the build command');\n  }\n};\n```\n\n<a name=\"custom-build-config\"></a>\n#### Configuration options\n\nOption            | Required       | Description\n------------------|----------------|-----------------------\n`cmd`             | **[required]** | The executable command\n`name`            | *[optional]*   | The name of the target. Viewed in the targets list (toggled by `build:select-active-target`).\n`args`            | *[optional]*   | An array of arguments for the command\n`sh`              | *[optional]*   | If `true`, the combined command and arguments will be passed to `/bin/sh`. Default `true`.\n`cwd`             | *[optional]*   | The working directory for the command. E.g. what `.` resolves to.\n`env`             | *[optional]*   | An object of environment variables and their values to set\n`errorMatch`      | *[optional]*   | A (list of) regular expressions to match output to a file, row and col. See [Error matching](#error-match) for details.\n`keymap`          | *[optional]*   | A keymap string as defined by [`Atom`](https://atom.io/docs/latest/behind-atom-keymaps-in-depth). Pressing this key combination will trigger the target. Examples: `ctrl-alt-k` or `cmd-U`.\n`atomCommandName` | *[optional]*   | Command name to register which should be on the form of `namespace:command`. Read more about [Atom CommandRegistry](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.4.1/CommandRegistry). The command will be available in the command palette and can be trigger from there. If this is returned by a build provider, the command can programatically be triggered by [dispatching](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.4.1/CommandRegistry#instance-dispatch).\n`targets`         | *[optional]*   | Additional targets which can be used to build variations of your project.\n`preBuild`        | *[optional]*   | **JS only**. A function which will be called *before* executing `cmd`. No arguments. `this` will be the build configuration.\n`postBuild`       | *[optional]*   | **JS only**. A function which will be called *after* executing `cmd`. A single argument `bool buildOutcome` indicating outcome of the running `cmd`. `this` will be the build configuration.\n\n#### Replacements\n\nThe following parameters will be replaced in `cmd`, any entry in `args`, `cwd` and\nvalues of `env`. They should all be enclosed in curly brackets `{}`\n\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE}` - Full path to the currently active file in Atom. E.g. `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build/lib/build.js`\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_PATH}` - Full path to the folder where the currently active file is. E.g. `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build/lib`\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_NAME}` - Full name and extension of active file. E.g., `build.js`\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_NAME_BASE}` - Name of active file WITHOUT extension. E.g., `build`\n  * `{PROJECT_PATH}` - Full path to the root of the project. This is normally the path Atom has as root. E.g `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build`\n  * `{REPO_BRANCH_SHORT}` - Short name of the current active branch (if project is backed by git). E.g `master` or `v0.9.1`.\n\n### Creating a build provider\nCreating a build provider require very little code in the easiest case, and can\nbe as complicated as necessary to achieve the correct functionality.\nRead more about building your own provider in [the create provider documentation](create-provider.md).\n\n<a name=\"error-match\"></a>\n## Error matching\n\nError matching lets you specify a single regular expression or a list of\nregular expressions, which capture the output of your build command and open the\ncorrect file, row and column of the error. For instance:\n\n```bash\n../foo/bar/a.c:4:26: error: expected ';' after expression\n  printf(\"hello world\\n\")\n                         ^\n                         ;\n1 error generated.\n```\n\nWould be matched with the regular expression: `(?<file>[\\\\/0-9a-zA-Z\\\\._]+):(?<line>\\\\d+):(?<col>\\\\d+):\\\\s+(?<message>.+)`.\nAfter the build has failed, pressing `cmd-alt-g` (OS X) or `ctrl-alt-g` (Linux/Windows)\n(or `f4` on either platform), `a.c` would be opened and the cursor would be placed at row 4, column 26.\n\nNote the syntax for match groups. This is from the [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/) package\nand has the syntax for named groups: `(?<name> RE )` where `name` would be the name of the group\nmatched by the regular expression `RE`.\n\nThe following named groups can be matched from the output:\n  * `file` - **[required]** the file to open. May be relative `cwd` or absolute. `(?<file> RE)`.\n  * `line` - *[optional]* the line the error starts on. `(?<line> RE)`.\n  * `col` - *[optional]* the column the error starts on. `(?<col> RE)`.\n  * `line_end` - *[optional]* the line the error ends on. `(?<line_end> RE)`.\n  * `col_end` - *[optional]* the column the error ends on. `(?<col_end> RE)`.\n  * `message` - *[optional]* Catch the humanized error message. `(?<message> RE)`.\n\nBackslashes must be escaped, thus the double `\\\\` everywhere.\n\nThe `file` should be relative the `cwd` specified. If no `cwd` has been specified, then\nthe `file` should be relative the project root (e.g. the top most directory shown in the\nAtom Editor).\n\nIf your build outputs multiple errors, all will be matched. Press `cmd-alt-g` (OS X) or `ctrl-alt-g` (Linux/Windows)\nto cycle through the errors (in the order they appear, first on stderr then on stdout), or you can use the\nAtom Linter integration discussed in the next section.\n\nOften, the first error is the most interesting since other errors tend to be secondary faults caused by that first one.\nTo jump to the first error you can use `cmd-alt-h` (OS X) or `shift-f4` (Linux/Windows) at any point to go to the first error.\n\n### Error matching and Atom Linter\n\nInstall [Atom Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) and all your matched errors will listed in a neat panel.\n\n![Linter integration](https://noseglid.github.io/build-linter.png)\n\n## Analytics\n\nThe `atom-build` package uses google analytics to keep track of which features are in use\nand at what frequency. This gives the maintainers a sense of what parts of the\npackage is most important and what parts can be removed.\n\nThe data is fully anonymous and can not be tracked back to you in any way.\nThis is what is collected\n\n  * Version of package used.\n  * Build triggered, succeeded or failed.\n  * Which build tool was used.\n  * Visibility of UI components.\n\nIf you really do not want to share this information, you can opt out by disabling\nthe [metrics package](https://atom.io/packages/metrics). This will disable all analytics\ncollection, including the one from `atom-build`.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build#readme","_id":"build@0.59.0","_shasum":"6631950fa00ca6dc31b1aa6d9945124f3cdfcbf5","_resolved":"file:../d-116321-23746-1qhmju2/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116321-23746-1qhmju2/package.tgz"}
